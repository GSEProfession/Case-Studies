    <p>Morbidity and mortality from the SARS-Cov-2 (Covid-19) virus is due to its effects on the respiratory system of patients. However, the virus is also present in the gut of many of those infected.Â  As a result, viral RNA is also present in domestic wastewater at sewage treatment works.</p>
    <p>In April 2020 the Joint Biosecurity Centre (now the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)), Environment Agency and Defra developed a surveillance system for SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Sampling began in July 2020 at 44 sewage works across England, covering around a third of the population. The programme is now one of the largest in the world, analysing 2800 samples a week from 450 sites in a dedicated new laboratory. The work relies on the Water Companies to take samples and Environment Agency staff to transport and analyse them with UKHSA and partners at Bangor University.</p>
    <p>Wastewater testing offers a different perspective on the course of infections such as SARS-Cov-2:</p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>The potential for early detection of infections before clinical cases manifest or from otherwise asymptomatic cases</li>
      <li>Insight into the course of the disease in populations where access to, or uptake of, clinical testing and healthcare is limited</li>
      <li>Monitoring of large populations at much lower cost than testing individuals</li>
    </ul></p>
