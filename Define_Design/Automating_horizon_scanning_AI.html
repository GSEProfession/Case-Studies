    <p>Early identification of emerging technologies and scientific breakthroughs can ensure that policymakers and other decision-makers are prepared to develop policy to foster the take-up of technologies. This early identification can allow organisations to allocate suitable resources to address future technological trends and requirements more efficiently. </p>
    <p>However, there are a multitude of approaches that help spot these emerging technologies which tend to be resource intensive. Our team have started to examine the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically identify emerging terminology in a variety of areas. NLP makes use of AI to process and produce useful information from substantial amounts of text data.</p>
    <p>We have set-up a cross government interest group, which looks at projects inside and outside of government. Currently we are looking at data and methods for early identification of development in emerging technologies such as:</p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>Finding term frequency in patents</li>
      <li>Topic modelling in academic journals</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>NLP has already helped us read large amounts of texts and flag key phrases for further investigation by our horizon scanners.</p>
    <p>For more information on the interest group please contact us.</p>
