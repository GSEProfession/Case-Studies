    <p>The Computational Science Centre for Research Communities (CoSeC) is a multi-decade programme of work run out of STFC’s Scientific Computing Department and based at the Daresbury and Rutherford Appleton Laboratories. It provides direct computational scientist support for the wide-reaching Collaborative Computational Project (CCPs) and High-End Consortia (HEC) programmes with funding from across UKRI.</p>
    <p>The CCP and HEC programmes bring together researchers from academia and industry around computational science themes that range from understanding how fundamental molecules interact through to helping design the next generation of low-carbon energy generation devices. </p>
    <p>Funded by UKRI’s EPSRC, BBSRC and MRC, The CoSeC programme underpins these communities, providing support from a pool of over 50 computational scientists and research software engineers. As a multi-disciplinary programme, CoSeC’swork touches on the majority of the sciences but has a particular focus on structural biology, computational engineering, materials modelling, medical and materials imaging, and underpinning technologies such as quantum computing. </p>
    <p>The breadth of experience and disciplinary skill-set of the team of scientists and research software engineers that make up CoSeCis truly world-class and will undoubtedly inform, direct and form a significant part of the UKRI Digital Research Infrastructure moving into the future. More details about CoSeCand the communities it supports can be found on its website.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The CoSeCteam is formed of around 50 scientists and research software engineers across both of STFC’s national laboratories. Each is expert in a specific scientific field but all work together across disciplines, making CoSeCa strong example of the benefits of interdisciplinary working in the sciences and as it works across the research councils, an embodiment of the fundamental idea of UKRI.</p>
