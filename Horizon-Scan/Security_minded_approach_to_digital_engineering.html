    <p>The adoption of digital technology and ways of working such as Building Information Modelling (BIM), Open Data and Digital Twins in the built environment creates new opportunities but also new risks.  In the construction sector and built environment it is already having a transformative effect, leading to: increased levels of collaboration, within and across sectors; more transparent, open ways of working; capture of real-time information about asset use and condition; sharing and use of digital data and information.</p>
    <p>This is increasingly done alongside off-site, factory-based fabrication and on-site automation is now being used. The use of sophisticated cyber-physical systems, combining sensors and actuators to increase energy efficiency and better asset lifecycle management, will become commonplace. This technology is already used in transportation, utilities, infrastructure, buildings, manufacturing, health care and defence leading to the creation of smart cities.</p>
    <p>The mitigation measures used to manage these security risks can also be applied to protect against the loss, theft or disclosure of valuable commercial information and intellectual property as well as personal data.  Embedding good security can enhance global positioning and give a competitive advantage to commercial enterprises by building trust with their stakeholders and customers.</p>
    <p>CPNI originally sponsored a British Standard PAS 1192-5 but more recently transformed it to an International Standard BS EN ISO 19650-5:2020 - a specification for security-minded information management. It provides a framework for organisations to understand key vulnerabilities and the controls needed to manage their security risks.  It can be applied by any organisation involved in the use of information management and technologies in the creation, design, construction, manufacture, operation, management, modification, improvement, demolition and/or recycling of assets or products within the built environment.</p>
