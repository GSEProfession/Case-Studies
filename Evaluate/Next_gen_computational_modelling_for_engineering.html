    <p>The Computational Engineering Group at STFC’s Daresbury Laboratory develop and use some of the UK’s cutting edge computer modelling software and techniques, often in conjunction with the UK’s leading academic and industrial organisations. This enables exciting new capability to capture the physical world around us at ever-increasing levels of detail.</p>
    <p>The Computational Engineering Group works across a wide range of project types, some in collaboration with external partners in academia and industry, some within STFC and its world-class scientific facilities. Fundamentally the group focusses on the simulation of fluids but more generally is involved in the computational modelling of engineering problems from across the sector. The group also pays particular attention to high-performance computing, helping to further develop how the UK utilises future super-computing capabilities and working directly with those shaping UKRI’s Digital Research Infrastructure.</p>
