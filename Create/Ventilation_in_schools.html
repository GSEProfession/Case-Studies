    <p>As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, evidence has mounted that the virus can be airborne and therefore ventilation is an important mitigation against transmission – and it has been known for some time that it is important to for wider health and wellbeing. However, achieving a good balance between ventilation and thermal comfort in education settings can be difficult.</p>
    <p>The Science Team supported the development of policy on provision of carbon dioxide monitors to schools, so that staff can identify where ventilation needs to be improved. We did this by linking with academic experts and ongoing research projects, bridging the gap between policy colleagues and deep specialists to help the policy team understand the key principles and available evidence; and using our own scientific and engineering expertise to provide technical advice and support. We also assessed the evidence on air cleaning devices, and advised on their suitability for spaces where good ventilation cannot be achieved. Working with experts, we created a technical specification to ensure that fit-for-purpose air cleaners can be obtained by the education sector. We have shared our experience and learning with other government departments and the devolved administrations.</p>
    <p>Together, our actions will help to reduce the risk of airborne disease transmission in schools and other education settings, supporting more face-to-face learning.</p>
