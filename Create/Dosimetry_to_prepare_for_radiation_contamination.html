    <p>With the increasing use of ionising radiation in society, the chance of an accident or incident is also on the rise. As part of UKHSA’s remit as a Category 1 emergency responder, the Cytogenetic Dosimetry Service team maintain preparedness to provide radiation dosimetry to support the triage of large numbers of potentially exposed individuals.</p>
    <p>The team provides the sole UK specialist cytogenetic dosimetry service to evaluate doses to people known or suspected of being exposed to ionising radiation. The service is based on analysing chromosome damage in blood cells to give an estimated dose and uncertainty. Radiation exposure scenarios are often complex, so the tests are tailored to individual exposure circumstances with results analysed on a case by case basis. In recent years, ‘fortuitous’ dosimetry on the basis of physical methods in materials individuals happen to be carrying has also been developed and implemented.</p>
    <p>Results</p>
    <p><ul>
    <li>Demonstrate false positives when an occupational dose recorded on a TLD badge was not really received by the wearer</li>
    <li>Confirm genuine overexposures and provide an additional estimate of dose independent of any physical or computational dosimetry method</li>
    <li>Give an indication of the whole or partial body nature of the exposure and the proportion of the body exposed, in support of individual treatment decisions</li>
    <li>Provide reassurance for those worried, but not exposed, which is especially important during a large scale population level event.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>UKHSA maintain readiness to respond to a small or large scale ionising radiation emergency, including through provision of biological dosimetry to estimate individual doses.</p>
